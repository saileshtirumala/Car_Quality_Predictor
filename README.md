# Car_Quality_Predictor
Predicting the quality of the car by using machine learning algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier 


In this project we classify the quality of the car by certain parameters of the car.

We implement 3 different algorithms in this project

1. Support Vector Machine
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier

We compare the performance of each machine learning model.
